#1) Description of methods and rationale are clearly communicated - 25 points: The grader understands why the the models were constructed and how.
#2) Successfully load data into the R environment - 20 points: I have encountered many issues with getting R to "play nice" with my data. This will likely take up ##relatively few lines of the final script but will take up a significant portion of my time.
#3) Comparison of continuous trait analyses: 30 points - The variation of the 3 spore characteristics of interest -- average length, average width and average quotient ##(Q = length/width)  are successfully mapped to the phylogeny, analyzed and comparisons are made between these analyses: Do any of these seem to have non-randomly ##distributed variation throughout the phylogeny? If more than one trait seems to vary non-randomly, are there similarities in ##their patterns?
#4) Brownian Motion and the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck models compared: 20 points - OU and BM models successfully constructed for all 3 continuous traits and comparisons are ##made between each set of OU and BM models.
#5) R script is fully functional - 5 points: I will probably not be able to accomplish this, but should receive somewhat fewer points if I do not.
